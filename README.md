# Nextflix 
A simple Netflix Clone made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ‚ö°

Currently, I have implemented the basic UI with media details fetch functionality.


Deployed it using vercel [here](https://nextflix-azure.vercel.app/).

## Running the project
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


### Set up environment variables

Get a TMDB API key from [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
You need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:
```
TMDB_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

### Run the project

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```

It runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
